an osu!droid server for relax players.

## All about osu!droid
osu!droid is a free-to-play circle clicking rhythm game for Android devices. It was a game hatched many years ago by the [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home) community. This project is now being developed by a small group of fans and also with the help of foreign friends.

## All about this relax server
osudroid!relax is an experimental and unofficial beta based on osu!droid, which allows you to submit scores using relax on a new server.

the main purpose why i renamed this to **osudroid!relax** is because i made the relax mod ranked, and it's score multi. to normal.

the other purpose of this is just nothing, but to play using relax casually.

## Features
this build has much more features, along with the cursor parities with rimu! compared to osu!droid (no offense, i do not hate the original build)

## Note
please take note that this is not akatsuki, but on android. i made this project for testing purposes if it works on another server. you can also [click here](https://akatsuki.gg) to visit the website if you want.
