A custom osu!droid build specifically built for relax players out there.

## All about osu!droid
osu!droid is a free-to-play circle clicking rhythm game for Android devices, which was inspired by osu!. It was a game that was hatched many years ago by the [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home) community. This project is now being developed by a small group of fans and also with the help of foreign friends.

Over time, the game is currently in development, as they add some parities and features to it.

## All about osu!
[osu!](https://github.com/ppy/osu) is a free-to-play circle clicking rhythm game for Windows, MacOS and Linux. This game is developed by Dean "peppy" Herbert, and it frequently updates with some important bug fixes and additions.

This game took inspiration from iNiS' Osu! Tatakae Ouendan for the Nintendo DS.

osu! consists of four modes, namely: osu!standard (Main Mode), osu!taiko, osu!mania, and osu!catch. The three modes took inspiration from other games, while osu!catch remained to be the original mode madeby Dean Herbert (peppy) itself. osu!mania was inspired by most mania rhythm games, while osu!taiko was inspired by [Taiko no Tatsujin (Taiko: Drum Master)](https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/taiko-no-tatsujin/taiko-no-tatsujin-the-drum-master).

## All about this relax server
osudroid!relax is an experimental and unofficial custom build of osu!droid, but the server is not implemented yet so it will remain on beta.

The main purpose why i renamed this to **osudroid!relax** is because i wanted to make my own build of osu!droid, which is for my youtube videos.

Currently, the game has a bunch of bugs, which might be replicable in-game. There are also experiments that weren't in the source code, you can find them through changing repository branches.

## Features
This custom build features a rework for performance points (pp), which only affects with the relax mod applied, alongside the experimental settings that would likely not work, further game optimization, and smaller playfield areas, *that could just make it playable like a tablet, so bring a stylus with you*.

## Note
Please take note that this is not akatsuki, but on android. I made this project for testing purposes anyway. If you want to visit it's own webpage, you can also [click here](https://akatsuki.gg) if you want to.

Older builds based on older versions of the game are completely outdated, so please update the game to it's latest version, thank you!
