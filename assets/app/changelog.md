# osudroid!relax v1.4 update (August 22, 2023)

With this update, this changes some behaviors of the game, alongside the PP rework i've been doing.

In this changelog, the game is now based on osu!droid 1.7, as it adds a bunch of new features to the game.

# Note
This is the first ever pre-release of the game, so far, until v1.3, the fame had no pre-releases, until that time i released it too fast.

I've been working on some additions to the game, as i tried to do some debugging in-game.

Most of the commits are from the osu!droid developers, since i have to try to work on new features.

# Additions

- Added multiplayer, but in the build, it will remain unavailable.
- Added a feature that when long pressing the random button, it will now show the last 10 beatmaps you recently played.
- Added video support, turning on this feature might give some lag as it's a video after all, *nonsense*
- Added experimental functions to experimental settings

# Changes and Fixes
- Fixed a bunch of game crashes, and bugs.
- Changed the way the cursor behaves, *matches with osu!stable and lazer*
- Reworked PP once again (buffed the multi by adding by 0.025x)
- Changed the texts at the start, *now shows the game version and what it's based on*
- Changed the server version, *since it crashes in the past few debug updates due to the connection being refused*
