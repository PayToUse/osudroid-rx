# osudroid!relax v1.5 update (August 29, 2023)

In this update, this features a pp rework, alongside the bug fixes and crashes.

# Note
Due to Typhoon Saola, the next release may be delayed due to it's battering on the east of the Luzon island in the Philippines.

To record the replay, please use the original build as this build corrupts the replay after playing a certain beatmap

# Changes
- Reworked PP, this change may debuff the calculation due to it's value being drastically high
- Added a feature when pressing the "random" button goes back to the last ten maps you currently played (forgot to mention this in v1.4)
- Made a few parities to the build from osu!droid
- Fixed a bug where the lag spike strikes randomly, which caused people to get their plays interrupted

If the problems still persist, please contact me on discord: paytouse
