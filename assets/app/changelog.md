# osudroid!relax v1.6 update (September 16, 2023)

In this update, this features a pp rework, changes to unstable rate, bug fixes and crashes.

# Note
I had worked hard on getting the right amount of pp in a certain beatmap, but unfortunately i can't because it needs some hard work to match it.

# Changes
- Reworked PP, this change reworks the calculation, along with the decrease multiplier
- Changed replay version from ``1`` to ``2`` in it's metadata
- Made a bunch of parities to the build from osu!droid
- Fixed a bug where the replays got corrupted after playing a certain beatmap
