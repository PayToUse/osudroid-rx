# osudroid!relax v1.8 update (October 2, 2023)

In this update, this updates the game version, alongside the updates to in-game multiplayer and the rework to performance points

# Note
Due to the version v1.7 update, we'll gonna skip it due to stuff in the update being discarded.

This will also be the update before the 1.7 patch, the v1.9 update will take much longer than usual.

# Changes
- Updated the game to 1.7.1
- Reworked the Performance Points, this change makes the calculation *nearly* match with stable this time.
- Optimized the game much better.
- Nerfed the Performance Points calculation with the `Small circle` mod
- Made a bunch of parities made by the osu!droid team
