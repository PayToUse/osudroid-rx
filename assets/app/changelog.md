# osudroid!relax v1.5 update (August 27, 2023)

In this update, this features a pp rework, alongside the bug fixes and crashes.

# Note
Due to Typhoon Saola, the next release may be delayed due to it's battering across the Luzon island in the Philippines.

# Changes
- Reworked PP, this change debuffs the calculation due to it's value being drastically high
- Added a feature when pressing the "random" button goes back to the last ten maps you currently played (forgot to mention this in v1.4)
